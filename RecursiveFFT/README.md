********RECURSIVE FAST FOURIER TRANSFORM*********

This folder contains the serial and parallel implementation of recursive fast fourier transform. 
The implementation of the serial version is accomplished by following the algorithm provided in the INTRODUCTION TO ALGORTIHMS, CLRS book. 
I've then identified the potential parallelizable regions and parallelized them using OpenMP constructs.
